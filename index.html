<h1> Introduction to PMPV</h1>

    <h2> Whats a Project ? </h2>
    
  <p> Project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product or service. <br/>  </p>
  
<ol>  
<li> Projects are unique </li>
<li> Projects are temporary in nature and have a definitive beginning and end date.</li>
<li> Projects are compelted when the project goals are achieved or it is determinated  the projects is not longer viable.</li>
<li> A sucessful project is one that meets or exceeds the expectations of your stakeholdes.</li>
   </ol> 
    
  <h2> How unique ? </h2>
    
 <ol>
<li> It has a definitive beginning and end effort.</li>
<li>It is not an ongoing effort such as in operations. </li>
<li>It ceases when objetive has been attained.</li>
<li>The team is disbanded upon project completion.</li> </ol>
        
    <h2> Example: </h2>
    
  <p> Building a road is an example of a project. The process of building a road takes a  finite amount of time, and prodices a unique product.

Operations, on the other hand, are repetitive.  Generating bills every month, and broadcasting news everyday are examples of operations.
Subprojects are components of a project that often contracted out. </p>
    
    
    <h2> What is a Project Management ? </h2>
    
    <p>  Is an application of knowledge , skills , tools and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements. </br>

    Project management is accomplished through the use of the processes such as: </p>


    <ol>
     <li> Initiating</li>
     <li> Planning  </li>
     <li> Executing </li>
     <li> Monitor and Controlling</li>
     <li> Closing </li>
    </ol>

<p>  Project managers or the organization can divide projects into above phases to provide better management control
with appropriate links to the ongoing operations of the performing organization. Collectively, these phases are known
as the project life cycle.  </br>


Project managers deliver projects while balancing the following constraints: </p>

<ol> 
    
   <li> Scope </li>
   <li> Schedule </li>
   <li> Quality </li>
   <li> Resources </li>
   <li> Customer satisfaction </li>
   <li> Risk </li>
    
    </ol>

<p> These all are so intewinded  that a change in one will most often cause a change in at least one of the others.</br>

For example: </p>

<ol>
    
    <li> If time is extended, the cost of the project will increase </li>
    <li> If time is extended  with the same cost then quality of the product will reduce 
If scope is extended the cost and the time  will be also extended. </li>
    
    </ol>
