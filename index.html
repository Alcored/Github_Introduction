<h1> Introduction to Website Deployment with GitHub webpages.</h1>

    
  <p> We have several ways to deploy a website to the public internet.<br/>
      To explain how a website deployment works we will be using the GitHub webpages.<br/> </p>
  
  <p> First that all lets start with what  GitHub is....</p>
      
  <p> <b> GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project </b> </p>
   
  <p> Considering the above mentioned  <b>a GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service. That's mean that a Github page is designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub
      
      repository. </b> </p>
    
  <h2> GitHub Deployment Architecture</h2>

   <br/>
          
  <p>-So now that we have understood what Github and GitHub pages are, We are ready to start working with the Deployment topic overview </p>
  
  <p> The first thing that we require is to create a GitHub Account. So that kindly Click on 
  the next link: <b> https://github.com/ </b> and  create your GitHub Account. <br/>
  
  <b> Finish? Great! </b><br/>
      
     
  <p> The next require thing  is to create a GitHub Repository.<br/>
  
  <b>So before to create the Github repository... lets understand What's it is ..</b> <br/> 
   <br/>   
  
 <i> A GitHub repository is : </i> an online, central storage place where we can store files and all the versions of those files. 
  We'll Use the repository  previously created in order to store the contents of our website.<br/>
    <br/>
      
 <b>Note I: </b> It´s pretty important  that your repository name use the GitHubPages naming convention so that be able to publish 
  properly.<br/>
  <br/>

    <p>Fig2.Example of the github name convetion. </p> <br/> 
          
 <b>Note II:</b> The Owner field contain the user-name information  which will be repeated on the Repository name in order to follow the GitHub naming convention.
  Once we have created the repository .github.io , we could  see it displayed on the webpages  as below:<br/>

    <p>Fig3.Githug page created.</p> <br/>
       
    

<p>Now that we have  the account & the Repository is important to know that we have two ways to upload our 
    site to Github. The first is directly on the GitHub pages (by Front End ) and the second is by using the command lines (Back end) </p>

    
  <p> <b> On the personal </b> I prefer the Front end  deployment option . The same due to it´s the most practical way to apply it. However is good to know both options in case that you could face any issue on the website.
  So... lets explore the backend option:</p>
        
    
  <h3> <b> I.- Back end option to upload  a site on GitHub (This option is generally used by ruby and jekyll generation files use)</b> </h3>
     
 
    <p> By using Git we will push (upload) the contents of the site´s directory to the new repository. <br/>
      To do so, we´ll initialize a Git repository in your sites directory. </p>

    <ul>
    <li> 	Open the terminal and use cd command to navigate to the sites directory.</li>
    <li> 	Initialize a Git repository with the git init command.</li>
    <li> 	Specify to Git where the repository will store your content site(The one you created on GitHub earlier). In order to specify the  repository using Git is required to add the  remote and label it as the 
                                                           origin.</li>
    <li> 	The remote is the URL of the repository that will store the site´s contents.</li>
    <li> 	The Origin is an alias for the remote. The before mention is in order to  avoide to having all the time type the lengthy remote URL over and over again, you can simply refer to it as origin later on.</li>
  </ul>
           
   <p>In the terminal , you can add the remote with the next command:</p>

  <b>git remote add origin https://github.com/your-user-name/your-user-name.github.io.git </b>
            
  <p>
  the URL  https://github.com/your-user-name/your-user-name.github.io.git  Is the  remote URL that refers to the repository we have created on GitHub earlier.<br/>
  ⦁	In the terminal, add the remote that points  to the repository  we created earlier </p>

 <p> Example: <br/>
            
 <b> git remote rm origin </b> </p>
            
 <p>After specify the remote  we will check that it has been added properly with the next command: git remote -v   
  (This command will list all the Git remotes and their corresponding URLS).<br/>
  After complete the mentioned steps is required to know exactly which files should be pushed to your repository.<br/>
  In case we would like to push all the site´s content to the repository . We will do the following thing: <br/>
  </p>
      <ol>
          <li> Add all your site content to the staging area by using the git add command. </li>
          <li> Save your changes by usin the commit  -m "Save my work"   command. </li>
       </ol>
<p>
  <b>Great, Now lets go to deploy our site! </b>

 <i> Starting deployment by typing the git push -u origin master command.</i>

  <b> Important: Remember that on this deploy step the authentification credentials will be requested.</b>
  </p>
           
           <br/>
           
  
<h3> <b> II.- Front end option to upload  a site on GitHub (This option is generally used when we create files by using HTML /
                                                          CSS /JS languages  and editors like Notepad++  or Atoms). </b> </h3>

 <p> <b>Go to your GitHub webpage and access your repository github.io.</b><br/>
 Once you are here you can start  by  uploading or  creating files on your master branch. <br/>

  <b>Note I: </b>
  Everything we start on our master branch and  that we'll commmit will be reflected on our URL. Due to the same this branch is consider like the 
  main of the branches.<br/>
  
   Considering the above mentioned is recommended to use gh-pages branch to apply  changes or  new versions over those to avoid 
   affecting the master branch and  also to be able to apply proper rollbacks. <br/>
  
After commit  our master branch we will be  automatically publishing  our site changes on  the public Internet.</p> <br/>
      
  <p> <b>Note II: </b>
      
 For the new  changes worked on the gh-pages branches we must apply a pull request after commit our changes. These pull request will 
 do two things, the first is to compare the new changes with the old version and the second thing is complete the  a proper 
 pull request authroization process to validate that new changes wont affect previous versions.
      
 </p>   <br/>   
    
 <p> Now that we have covered the main topics, lets remember what is the relevant information that we  have to remember about this Introductory course: </p>

        <ul>
            <li> 	We had an overview about what GitHub is and for what we could  use it.</li>
            <li> 	We saw an overview about the Github webpages structure such as Account, Repositories and Master Branche creation.</li>
            <li> 	We learned that there are two options to  deploy a site on the public internet.One of these  
                was the  back end option (by cmd commands) which usually  is applied for Ruby and Jekyll languages,and the second 
                by  Front End option  ( webpages deployment) used for  the  creation /uploading  of file, basically created on languages
                such as html /css/JS/php etc...).</li>
         </ul>
        
  <p> 
      <b>Hope this Github Introduction could be helpfull for you to understand more about the  possible deployment options.<br/></b>
  <b>Eventually more detailed information and Github webpages  courses will be published on this website as well as a how to manual for some tricks and or solutions for issues while deploying or configurating GitHub.</b>  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>My best wishes</b> <br/>
