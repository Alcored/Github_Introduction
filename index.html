<h1> <b> Introduction to PMP </b> </h1>

    <h2> Whats a Project ?  </h2>
    
  <p> Project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product or service. <br/>  </p>
  
<ol>  
<li> Projects are unique </li>
<li> Projects are temporary in nature and have a definitive beginning and end date.</li>
<li> Projects are compelted when the project goals are achieved or it is determinated  the projects is not longer viable.</li>
<li> A sucessful project is one that meets or exceeds the expectations of your stakeholdes.</li>
   </ol> 
    
  <h2> How unique ? </h2>
    
 <ol>
<li> It has a definitive beginning and end effort.</li>
<li>It is not an ongoing effort such as in operations. </li>
<li>It ceases when objetive has been attained.</li>
<li>The team is disbanded upon project completion.</li> </ol>
        
    <h2> Example: </h2>
    
  <p> Building a road is an example of a project. The process of building a road takes a  finite amount of time, and prodices a unique product.

Operations, on the other hand, are repetitive.  Generating bills every month, and broadcasting news everyday are examples of operations.
Subprojects are components of a project that often contracted out. </p>
    
    
    <h2> What is a Project Management ? </h2>
    
    <p>  Is an application of knowledge , skills , tools and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements. </br>

    Project management is accomplished through the use of the processes such as: </p>


    <ol>
     <li> Initiating</li>
     <li> Planning  </li>
     <li> Executing </li>
     <li> Monitor and Controlling</li>
     <li> Closing </li>
    </ol>

<p>  Project managers or the organization can divide projects into above phases to provide better management control
with appropriate links to the ongoing operations of the performing organization. Collectively, these phases are known
as the project life cycle.  </br>


Project managers deliver projects while balancing the following constraints: </p>

<ol> 
    
   <li> Scope </li>
   <li> Schedule </li>
   <li> Quality </li>
   <li> Resources </li>
   <li> Customer satisfaction </li>
   <li> Risk </li>
    
    </ol>

<p> These all are so intewinded  that a change in one will most often cause a change in at least one of the others.</br>

For example: </p>

<ol>
    
    <li> If time is extended, the cost of the project will increase </li>
    <li> If time is extended  with the same cost then quality of the product will reduce 
If scope is extended the cost and the time  will be also extended. </li>
    
<li>if scope is extended then cost and time will also extended</li>

<p> Changes to any of these legs sets off a series of activities that are needed to integrate the change across the project </p>

<h2> What is Program Management ? </h2>

<p>A program consists of a group of related projects and Program management is the process of managing multiple on going projects. 

</br>An example would be that of designing, manufacturing and providing support infrastructure for an automobile make.</br>

Program management involves centrally managing and coordinating groups of related projects to meet the objectives of the program.</br>

In some cases Project Management is a subset of Program Management. </br>

The project manager may report to the program manager in such cases. A portfolio consists of multiple programs.

</p>


<h2> What is Portfolio Management ? </h2>

<p> A portfolio is a collection of projects, programs subportfolios, and operations that are grouped together to facilitate effective management of that work to meet strategic business objectives. Organizations manage their portfolios based on specific goals.

Senior managers or senior management teams typically take on the responsibility of portfolio management for an organization.</br>

Portfolio management encompasses managing the collections of programs and projects in the portfolio. This includes weighing the value of each project, or potential project, against the portfolio's strategic objectives.</br>

Portfolio management also concerns monitoring active projects for adherence to objectives, balancing the portfolio among the other investments of the organization, and assuring the efficient use of resources.

</p>

<h2> Why do we need Project Management? </h2>
<p> We need project management to manage projects effectively and drive them to success. Project Management starts with the decision to start a project upon weighing its need and viability. Once a project starts, it is crucial to watch the project progress at every step so as to ensure it delivers what all is required, in the stipulated time, within the allocated budget. Other drivers influencing the need of project management are: </p>

<ul>

<li> Exponential expansion of human knowledge</li>
<li>Global demand for goods and services</li>
<li>Global competition</li>
<li>Team is required to meet the demand with quality and standard.</li>
<li>Improved control over the project</li>
<li>Improved performance</li>
<li>Improved budget and quality</li>

</ul>


<h2>Project Management Skills:</h2>

<p> Many of the tools and techniques for managing projects are specific to project management. However, effective project management requires that the project management team acquire the following three dimensions of project management competencies:

</p>


<ul>

<li>Project Management Knowledge Competency: This refers to what the project management team knows about project management.</li>
<li>Project Management Performance Competency: This refers to what the project management team is able to do or accomplish while applying their project management knowledge.</li>
<li>Personal Competency: This refers to how the project management team behaves when performing the project or activity.</li>

</ul>


<h2> Interpersonal Skills Management: </h2>

<p>The management of interpersonal relationships includes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Effective communication: The exchange of information</li>
<li>Influencing the organization: The ability to "get things done"</li>
<li>Leadership: Developing a vision and strategy, and motivating people to achieve that vision and strategy</li>
